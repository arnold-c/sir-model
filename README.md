## SIR Model
### About This Project

This is a test project to get used to using Git and GitHub.

The purpose of this project is to create a SIR model in R.
An SIR model is a model that describes the spread of a disease in a population, placing individuals in compartments based on their infection status.
The compartments are susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R).
The model is described by the following equations:

```math
\begin{align}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= \mu (N - S) -\beta S \frac{I}{N} \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta S \frac{I}{N} - \gamma I - \mu I \\
\frac{dR}{dt} &= \gamma I - \mu R
\end{align}
```

```math
\begin{align}
\mu &= \frac{1}{50*52} \\
\beta &= 2 \\
\gamma &= \frac{1}{2} \\\\

N &= 1000 \\
S\_0 &= 999.0 \\
I\_0 &= 1.0 \\
R\_0 &= 0.0
\end{align}
```

Here, $\mu$ is the mortality and birth rate, $\beta$ is the contact rate multiplied by the per-contact transmission probability, and $\gamma$ is the recovery rate.
The units for this are weeks, so the life expectancy is 50 years, and the duration of infection (inverse of recovery rate) is 2 weeks.

Most of the code is adapted from Ottar Bjornstad's *Epidemics: Models and Data in R* (2018) book. You can find the code at his GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/objornstad/epimdr). Specifically, it uses code from chapter 2.
